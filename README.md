# spot it game

My family plays Spot it with my grandpa pretty often because of its great effects on memory and reflexes. The idea of the game is to be given 2 cards with 8 symbols on each card, and then to have to identify which symbol is shared in the 2 cards. Every pair of 2 cards in the deck has *exactly* one shared symbol. One day while playing, my brother and I started wondering how this game is actually algorithmically implemented - how can every single 2 cards have exactly one shared symbol, but only 8 symbols on each card??

So, after dinner for a few hours, we went about figuring out how to implement this. The algorithm is geometrically based, and pretty cool. 

Here's the implementation! Cleaned up code / algorithm explanation to come soon when I am not drowning in school
